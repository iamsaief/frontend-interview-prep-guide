# ‚ö° 50 React Interview Q&A

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture & Core Concepts

**Q1. What are the limitations of React in building large-scale applications?**
A1. React is only a view library; scaling requires external solutions for routing, state, and architecture.

Q2. How does React manage the Virtual DOM, and what are the benefits?
A2. React diffs the Virtual DOM against the previous tree and batches updates, minimizing real DOM operations.

Q3. Can React Hooks fully replace Redux for state management? Explain why or why not. A3. Hooks can replace Redux in smaller apps, but Redux (or alternatives) is better for complex, shared global state.

Q4. What are the best practices for managing state in large React applications?
A4. Use local state for UI, Context for cross-cutting concerns, and external stores for complex global state.

Q5. How would you optimize performance in a React app with large component trees?
A5. Use memoization, code-splitting, virtualization, and avoid unnecessary re-renders.

Q6. Explain React's Strict Mode and its impact on development. A6. StrictMode highlights unsafe lifecycles, double-invokes effects, and warns about legacy patterns.

Q7. How can you prevent unnecessary re-renders in React functional components?
A7. Use React.memo, useCallback, useMemo, and avoid passing new object/array references unnecessarily.

Q8. Describe the key differences between functional and class components in React. A8. Functional components are simpler, hook-based, and preferred; class components are legacy but supported.

Q9. What is the significance of the React Fiber architecture?
A9. Fiber enables incremental rendering, prioritization, and concurrency for smoother UIs.

Q10. How does React handle side effects, and how can you manage them effectively?
A10. Side effects are handled with useEffect; manage cleanup and dependencies carefully.

## üóÇÔ∏è State Management

Q11. Explain the differences between useMemo() and useCallback() in React.
A11. useMemo caches computed values; useCallback caches function references.

Q12. How would you implement dynamic form handling and validation in React?
A12. Use controlled inputs with libraries like React Hook Form for scalable validation.

Q13. What is lazy loading in React, and how does it improve application performance?
A13. Lazy loading splits bundles and loads components only when needed.

Q14. How would you handle errors in a React app, and what is the role of error boundaries?
A14. Error boundaries catch render errors in child components and display fallback UI.

Q15. What are the benefits of server-side rendering (SSR) in React applications?
A15. SSR improves SEO, performance, and perceived load time.

Q16. How do you handle styling in React components? Discuss different approaches. A16. Options include CSS Modules, CSS-in-JS, Tailwind, or styled-components.

Q17. How would you pass data between sibling components in React without using Redux?
A17. Lift state up or use Context for sibling communication.

Q18. Explain the use case of useEffect() for fetching data from an API. A18. useEffect is ideal for fetching data on mount or dependency change.

Q19. How do you handle asynchronous operations in React using async/await or Promises?
A19. Use async/await inside effects or event handlers, with proper cleanup.

Q20. How would you re-render a component when the window is resized?
A20. Attach a resize listener in useEffect and update state on change.

Q21. Describe how React Context API can be used for state management in an app. A21. Context API shares state globally without prop drilling.

Q22. What is the role of React Router, and how does it work with dynamic routing?
A22. React Router maps URLs to components and supports dynamic params.

Q23. Explain the concept of controlled and uncontrolled components in React. A23. Controlled components bind value to state; uncontrolled rely on refs.

Q24. How would you optimize React app performance when handling large lists or grids?
A24. Use virtualization (react-window, react-virtualized).

Q25. Explain the difference between shallow and deep comparison in React's shouldComponentUpdate. A25. Shallow compares props/state; deep compares nested structures.

Q26. How do you handle asynchronous code execution and state updates in React?
A26. State updates are batched and async; use functional updates when relying on previous state.

Q27. How would you implement custom hooks to abstract logic in React?
A27. Encapsulate reusable logic in a function starting with use.

Q28. What are higher-order components (HOCs) in React, and how are they used?
A28. HOCs wrap components to inject props or behavior.

Q29. How would you implement a search feature with debouncing in React?
A29. Debounce input changes with setTimeout or lodash.

Q30. Explain React's reconciliation process and how it updates the DOM efficiently. A30. Reconciliation matches elements by keys and updates only changed nodes.

---

## üöÄ Advanced & Performance

Q31. How would you design a scalable folder and component architecture for a large React application?
A31. Organize by feature/domain, use atomic design, and enforce separation of concerns.

Q32. Compare Redux Toolkit, Zustand, and Recoil. A32. Redux Toolkit is boilerplate-free, Zustand is lightweight, Recoil is flexible but experimental.

Q33. How do you handle global state vs. local state trade-offs in a React application?
A33. Global state for cross-cutting concerns; local state for isolated UI.

Q34. What are the pitfalls of overusing Context API, and how can you mitigate them?
A34. Overuse causes re-renders; split contexts or memoize values.

Q35. Explain how Suspense works in React. A35. Suspense lets components wait for async data with fallback UI.

Q36. How does React‚Äôs concurrent rendering improve perceived performance?
A36. It allows interruptible rendering but may reorder updates unexpectedly.

Q37. What strategies would you use to optimize bundle size in a React application?
A37. Use tree-shaking, dynamic imports, and bundle analysis.

Q38. How would you implement infinite scrolling in React?
A38. Use IntersectionObserver with virtualization for performance.

Q39. How would you debug and fix memory leaks in React?
A39. Always clean up effects (e.g., unsubscribe in useEffect).

Q40. How do you handle race conditions in React async requests?
A40. Track request IDs or cancel stale promises.

---

## üåç SSR, Routing & Data

Q41. What are the trade-offs between Next.js and client-side rendering?
A41. Next.js offers SSR/SSG/ISR for SEO and performance; CSR is simpler but less SEO-friendly.

Q42. How would you implement authentication and authorization in React?
A42. Use route guards, context, or HOCs for protected routes.

Q43. What are the best practices for handling forms at scale in React?
A43. Use React Hook Form for performance or Formik for features.

Q44. How would you implement optimistic UI updates in React?
A44. Update state immediately, then roll back if the server fails.

Q45. How would you integrate React with GraphQL?
A45. Use Apollo/Relay for queries, caching, and normalization.

---

## ‚öñÔ∏è Accessibility, Testing & UX

Q46. How do you ensure accessibility in React components?
A46. Use semantic HTML, ARIA roles, and tools like axe or Lighthouse.

Q47. How would you implement internationalization (i18n) in React?
A47. Use i18next or react-intl with context providers.

Q48. What strategies would you use to test React components?
A48. Unit test with Jest/RTL, integration with Cypress/Playwright.

Q49. How do you handle error logging and monitoring in production React apps?
A49. Use Sentry, LogRocket, or custom logging with error boundaries.

Q50. Imagine your React app‚Äôs performance degrades at scale. How do you fix
A50. Profile with React DevTools, Lighthouse, and Chrome Profiler; fix by memoization, virtualization, and reducing bundle size.
